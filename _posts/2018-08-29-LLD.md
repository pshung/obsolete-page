# After symbol resolution.
Writer::run
* createSyntheticSections,  create linker synthesized sections as input sections
  * Note that putting those in InputSections is a key notion, because those InputSections will be matched by linker script rules later. Only a few of OutputSection are created directly such ELFHeader section, ProgramHeader section.
* processSectionCommands
	* add linker script defined symbols and put matched InputSections into a OutputSection
		* Note: the address of OutputSection and InputSection are not decided yet.
	* addOrphanSections
		* Orphan section: the InputSections are specified by a linker script, so linker assigns them to default OutputSection and orders those default OutputSections.
		* create new OutputSections or add into existing OutputSections for those orphan sections at the end of SectionCommands
		* Note that OutputSection specified in linker script are ordered in SectionCommands and has a section index assigned, and those linker created OutputSection for the orphan section are listed at the end of SectionCommand with a UINT_MAX section index.
* finalizeSections
  * add section content, e.g., .got section, .plt section, symbol table.
	* Once the section content has been finalized, the size of those synthesized OutputSection has been decided; thus, we can assign the address later.
		* scanRelocations
		* removeUnusedSyntheticSections
			* After scanRelocations, we know if the synthetic sections are empty or not. e.g., .got, .plt. Since they have been added into an OutputSection, remove it from OutputSection's InputSection list.
		* sortSections
			* adjustSectionsBeforeSorting
				* remove those empty OutputSection, an OutputSection is alive if there was an InputSection added, but an OutputSection may have empty InputSection list since those synthetic sections may be removed.
				* empty condition is not enough to decide if the SectionCommand should be removed or not. Consider byte(), word() commands.
				* recap: InputSection's live property is decided by GC pass. OutputSection's live property is set if there's an InputSection added.
			* sortInputSections
			* sort Orphan OutputSections.
			* adjustSectionsAfterSorting
				* assign a memory region
		* establish OutputSections vector (only non-discarable OutputSection)
		* assign section index for each in OututSections vector
		* createPhdrs: create program header
		* finalize all synthetic sections (finalizeContents)
* Script->assignAddresses()
		* assign address for symbols and output sections.
