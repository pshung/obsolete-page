# Naming of setter and getter methods
If you have a struct field called **value**, how to name the setter and getter methods?
It's suggested to use **Value** as getter method and **SetValue** as setter method.

# MixedCap naming for multiword names.
The convention in Go is to use MixedCaps or mixedCaps rather than underscores
to write multiword names.
example: nextNumber or NextNumber rather than next_number

# Control structure: if
If and switch can accept an optional initialization statement, it's common to
see one used to set up a local variable.
example:
```go
if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
// function body
}
```
