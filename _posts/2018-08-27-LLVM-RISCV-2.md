# Why global instruction selection?
* Faster compile time (avoid LLVM to SelectionDAG translation phase)
* better run time performance (match complex pattern across basic blocks)
* share code between fast and optimized selection
* more modularity (divide whole instruction selection into a pipeline of passes).
