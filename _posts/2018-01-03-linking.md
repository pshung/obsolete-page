When you compile a hello world problem, it has to link the standard C library at least. How does the linker know the dependence of HelloWorld?


## DT_NEEDED entry in .dynamic
To use a specific shared library, you have to specify its name to provide symbol definition for a placeholder when compiling the program.

```
gcc hello.c -lc -o hello
```
(Though, compiler always implicitly add '-lc')
Then, the linker will record the dependent shared libraries in the **dynamic section**.
```
readelf -d hello
```
```
Dynamic section at offset 0xdf0 contains 26 entries:
Tag Type Name/Value
0x0000000000000001 (NEEDED) Shared library: [libc.so.6]

```
Entry **DE_NEEDED** records the **SONAME** of libc.
What is SONAME? and How does a linker know the version of the shared library?
## Version of shared library
In order to remain the ABI compatibility, UNIX defines a convention about how to number the version of a shared library.

> libABC.so.x.y.z



* library name(ABC)
* major number(x): Distinct major numbers are incompatible.
* minor number(y): Higher minor number is compatible with lower one.
* release number(z): All release numbers are compitible.

Example:
* libABC.so.1 is incompatible with libABC.so.2.
* libABC.so.1.2 is compatible with libABC.so.1.1.
* libABC.so.1.1 is compatible with libABC.so.1.2.
* libABC.so.1.2.2 is compatible with libABC.so.1.2.1.

## SONAME
To reduce the space, system won't have all versions of shared libraries.
Since higher minor number is compatible with lower one and release numbers are all compatible.

SONAME records only library name and the major number.\
System will create a symbolic link pointing to the shared library with the highest minor number.

Example:\
libABC.so.1.2.2 and libABC.so.1.1.1.\
Both have the SONAME as libABC.so.1.\
libABC.so.1 will point to libABC.so.1.2.2(The highest minor number).\

In the above case, linker only records the SONAME, and only one shared library exists in the system.



## Conclusion
ABI compatibility is hard to maintain since the language feature and architecutre convention.\
Therefore, version control of shared library is a critical issue.\
UNIX defines three kinds of version number so that we can know whether shared libraries are compatible or not.
