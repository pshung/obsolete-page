# ALU instruction
Most ALU instructions can be matched by tablegen.  
Only G_ICMP cannot be matched.  
Consider G_ICMP with (unsigned) less than condition code.  
It can be mapped to slt and slts.  

# Case
```
define i32 @sltu(i32 %a, i32 %b) nounwind {
; CHECK-LABEL: sltu:
; CHECK:       # %bb.0:
; CHECK-NEXT:    sltu a0, a0, a1
; CHECK-NEXT:    ret
  %1 = icmp ult i32 %a, %b
  %2 = zext i1 %1 to i32
  ret i32 %2
}
```

# Select G_ICMP LT/ULT
G_ICMP is legal for {s1, s32} pair of type.
Pattern of SelectionDAG of setcc is not compatiable with GSel.  
We select it with code.  
map to RISC-V slts (LT predicate code) and slt (ULT predicate code)  

# Select G_ZEXT
Select it with code.
map to RISC-V andi %x, 1

# Output
```
  slt a0, a0, a1
  andi  a0, a0, #1
  ret
```
# Example 2
```
define i32 @slti(i32 %a) nounwind {
; RV32I-LABEL: slti:
; RV32I:       # %bb.0:
; RV32I-NEXT:    slti a0, a0, 2
; RV32I-NEXT:    ret
  %1 = icmp slt i32 %a, 2
  %2 = zext i1 %1 to i32
  ret i32 %2
}

```

# Select G_CONSTANT?

G_CONSTANT can be mapped to addi x0, imm, but can we select G_CONSTANT and G_ICMP into single slti?  
TableGen for SelectionDAG can perform this kind of selection automatically. How does it do it?  

In RISCVGenGlobalISel.inc, there is a match table used to guide the statemachine of matching process.
Matching logical: InstructionSelectorImpl.h InstructionSelector::executeMatchTable  
Matching instruction: MatchTable0.
Take addi as an example:  
Rule: When matching G_ADD, also matching the definition instruction of the second operand, if it's G_CONSTANT then select to ADDI.
